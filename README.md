# typescript-trait-play

An attempt to enable stateful [traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that allow a class to express one or more traits, optionally allowing the class to override the default functionality provided by the traits via method overriding.

Based on TypeScript pull request ["Mixin classes"](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/13743).
