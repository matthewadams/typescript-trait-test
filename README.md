# typescript-trait-play

An attempt to enable stateful [traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that allow a class to express one or more traits, allowing the class to override the default functionality provided by the traits via method overriding.
This work is trying to provide the same functionality as [@northscaler/mutrait](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@northscaler/mutrait) in TypeScript.

> NOTE: this is currently broken as we work to get the typings correct.
